"""Math concept extractor.

Takes transiently fetched paper content and extracts structured mathematical
knowledge (theorems, definitions, lemmas, etc.) for persistence in SQLite + ChromaDB.

The extraction logic here is a stub — it will be driven by the model layer
once that is implemented. The interface is stable.
